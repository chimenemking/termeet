‚ú® It's Not Just a Store, It's a Vibe
This project focuses on the feel of luxury. The goal wasn't just to display products, but to create a digital environment that reflects the craftsmanship and prestige of a high-end watch brand. Every interaction, from the subtle page transitions to the weighty micro-animations, is intentionally designed to feel premium.

üõ†Ô∏è The Toolbox
Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Animations: Framer Motion

Fonts: Geist Sans & Geist Mono

Deployment: Vercel

üéØ What It Does
Cinematic Hero: A dynamic grid-based layout with a live clock that sets the tone immediately.

Product Showcase: A filtered, animated grid of products with elegant cards.

Protected Details: A login-gated product detail page (bypass available for demo).

Motion-Enhanced FAQ: An elegant accordion section that builds trust and answers questions.

Responsive & Sharp: Looks and feels impeccable on any device.
You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
